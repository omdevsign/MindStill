Hi.

Watch the video to see the package installation process.

Download the URP materials and terrain.
I also made some corrections models are included in the package.

You'll see some pink assets at the end of the video, but that's already fixed in the latest version of the package.

At the moment, the assets use several materials, but I will send the asset store update soon.
Good luck;)

Wait for the next URP fixes for the remaining packages.
